# ðŸ’§ Water Tracker App

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This is a beautifully simple water tracking app designed to help users build better hydration habits. My goal was to create an intuitive, aesthetically pleasing experience that makes logging daily water intake effortless. The Code is Not Live and not regularly documented on here. Coming to the AppStore Soon ðŸ‘€

This project deepened my knowledge of **SwiftUI**, **@AppStorage for persistent data**, and **animation techniques** for visually tracking progress. It also pushed me to refine UI/UX to keep things clean, minimal, and easy to use.

Also keeping it simple with the data storage on the device, In the future cloud saving might be a good thing to implement but this approach fits the mission I am going for. Lightweight no fuss app that you can track your liquid/water consumption.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned
- **State Management & Data Persistence**: Used `@AppStorage` to store user hydration data persistently across app launches.
- **Animations & UI Design**: Implemented a **fluid water fill animation** to represent real-time intake progress.
- **Custom User Input Handling**: Added options to set personalized goals and adjust water intake amounts dynamically.
- **Basic Data Logging**: Integrated a simple calendar view that tracks daily intake history.

## ðŸŒŠ Features
âœ” **Quick Add Water** â€“ Tap to log hydration instantly.
âœ” **Custom Goals & Fill Amounts** â€“ Set and adjust intake targets easily.
âœ” **Visual Water Fill Animation** â€“ See progress dynamically with an animated water bottle.
âœ” **Daily Reset Logic** â€“ Automatically resets intake each day.
âœ” **Calendar History Tracking** â€“ View past hydration data for consistency.
âœ” **Minimalist UI** â€“ Clean and distraction-free design for smooth interaction.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works
1. **Set a daily goal** (default: 128 oz).
2. **Tap to log water intake** â€“ Default add amount is 8 oz but can be customized.
3. **Track progress visually** through a dynamic water fill effect.
4. **View history in the calendar** â€“ Stay accountable for hydration streaks.
5. **Reset daily intake automatically** at the start of each new day.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission
I built this app to create a **seamless** and **engaging** way to track hydration. Simplicity is keyâ€”no bloated features, just an elegant way to build a **healthy water-drinking habit**. Moving forward, I plan to:
- Improve data visualization with more advanced insights ðŸ“Š
- Add reminders & notifications ðŸ””
- Explore Apple HealthKit integration for deeper tracking ðŸ“±
- Create Cloud data storing
- Possible AI insights and Calculator for less educated Users
