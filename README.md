# 💧 Water Tracker App

## 📌 About the Project
This is a beautifully simple water tracking app designed to help users build better hydration habits. My goal was to create an intuitive, aesthetically pleasing experience that makes logging daily water intake effortless.  
The code is not live and not regularly documented here. Coming to the App Store soon 👀

This project deepened my knowledge of **SwiftUI**, **@AppStorage for persistent data**, and **animation techniques** for visually tracking progress.  
It also pushed me to refine UI/UX to keep things clean, minimal, and easy to use.

Keeping it simple with the data storage on the device — in the future, cloud saving might be a good feature to implement, but this approach fits the mission:  
**Lightweight, no-fuss app** that helps users track their water consumption effortlessly.

## 🚀 What I Learned
- **State Management & Data Persistence**: Used `@AppStorage` to store user hydration data persistently across app launches.
- **Animations & UI Design**: Implemented a **fluid water fill animation** to represent real-time intake progress.
- **Custom User Input Handling**: Added options to set personalized goals and adjust water intake amounts dynamically.
- **Basic Data Logging**: Integrated a simple calendar view that tracks daily intake history.

## 🎯 Mission
I built this app to create a **seamless** and **engaging** way to track hydration.  
Simplicity is key — no bloated features, just an elegant way to build a **healthy water-drinking habit**.

Moving forward, I plan to:
- Improve data visualization with more advanced insights 📊
- Add reminders & notifications 🔔
- Explore Apple HealthKit integration for deeper tracking 📱
- Create cloud data storing
- Possibly add AI insights and calculators for less educated users
